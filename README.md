# Ingredient Adjuster

A cookie recipe calls for the following ingredients:

• 1.5 cups of sugar


• 1 cup of butter


• 2.75 cups of flour

The recipe produces 48 cookies with these amounts of the ingredients. 

Write a program that asks the user how many cookies he or she wants to make and then displays the number of cups of each ingredient needed for the specified number of cookies.  You may choose to input your data with either the Scanner class or using dialog boxes – your choice.  
Be sure your response uses full sentences, and repeats the number of cookies entered by the user.

Be careful to use the correct data types, and limit your decimals to two digits.
